The test wasn't too difficult, but the redirects did cause me a bit of trouble for a while. This was mainly due to minor oversights on my part. Despite the simplicity of the task, the complexity of managing redirects required a great deal of attention to detail. The fact that I was borrowing a PC that wasn't mine and was old complicated the exam, but overall it was the test that gave me the most pleasure of the day :)

j'ai eu un probl√®me avec l'importation jinjas, je pense que c'est du a mon pc j'ai fais le maximum pour trouver la solution..
